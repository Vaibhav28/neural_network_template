A 3-layer neural network template for classification, implemented in MATLAB and python.

Suitable for continuous independent variables and dependent variable designating 2 or more classes.

Regression parameters are learned by minimizing a cost function with fmincg (MATLAB/Octave).

Splits input data file into training and test sets.

Computes the following performance metrics:
	Test and training set prediction accuracy
	Confusion matrix, specificity, sensitivity

Based on Ex.4 of ml-class.org.
