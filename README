A 3-layer neural network template for classification, implemented in MATLAB and python.

Suitable for data with continuous independent variables and a dependent variable designating 2 or more classes.

Each data row must be complete (no missing values).

Features must be numerical.	
Classes must be designated with consecutive integers, starting from 1 (Ex: {1,2,3,4} but not {1,2,4}). 
Every class must be represented in training set.
Due to Octave/MATLAB syntax, '0' cannot be used to designate a class.

Output layer uses sigmoid as activation function.

Regression parameters are learned by minimizing a cost function with fmincg (MATLAB/Octave).

Splits input data file into training and test sets.

Computes the following performance metrics:
	Test and training set prediction accuracy
	Confusion matrix

Based on Ex.4 of ml-class.org.

Datasets used:
	Fisher's Iris: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
	Wine: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine
	Glass Identification: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Glass+Identification

Dataset processing steps: 
	Labels of "0" in these datasets have been replaced with non-zero values to accomodate MATLAB/Octave syntax.
	Classes in Wine dataset were relabeled to consecutive integers.
	The class column has been moved to the last column in the dataset.
